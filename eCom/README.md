This is a ECommerce application created using Javascript and NodeJs. This application assigns every shopper with their own personal cart. Shoppers purchases are calculated dynamically which allows changes in cart total being displayed and updated based on adding or removing items from cart.
There is also the functionality to perform CRUD operations only by Admins which are required to make an account and sign in with the correct credentials to be able to access the Admin Dashboard.
Newly registered Admins passwords will be hashed to provide better security. Only upon sign in can items within the store be modified.
